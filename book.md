How we built TodoMVC - Example
==============================

#Prologue
[TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/) is an internet project which offers
several implementations to a well defined application using various popular 
JavaScript MV* frameworks. We have implemented TodoMVC using [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) 
as our MV* frameworks, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) as our templating engine, and 
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) as our AMD framework. Before continuing, you should get familiarized with the basic
concepts of the aforementioned frameworks and the flow of the TodoMVC application. In this text we present
and explain the various decisions we took while developing the TodoMVC application. Please feel free to leave your comments
and text edits in the [issues](https://github.com/BorisKozo/TodoMVC-Example/issues) section.
