TodoMVC-Example
===============
This project aims to provide an easy and simple to follow end to end implementation of a Single Page JavaScript application, that uses Backbone.js, Backbone.Marionette, and Handlebars over RequireJS.

The project has two integral parts. 
* The [code](https://github.com/BorisKozo/TodoMVC-Example) of a sample application
* A [book](https://github.com/BorisKozo/TodoMVC-Example/blob/master/book.md) which describes how we implemented the sample application while explaining the varios considerations for constructing such application. While the book describe the sample application, it aims at helping developers to better understand JavaScript Single Page Application developement in general, and espcically using the aformentiond frameworks.  

The Project is based on the famous [TodoMVC project](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/).
